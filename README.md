# Diabetes_Prediction_model
This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient is diabetic based on features like glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, and others. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, a well-known medical dataset used for binary classification problems
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health parameters. The model is trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and aims to assist in early detection and intervention.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `diabetes_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**, which includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable, "Outcome". The dataset is publicly available and widely used for benchmarking diabetes prediction models.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The project employs the **Logistic Regression** algorithm to classify whether a patient has diabetes based on input features. Logistic Regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification problems.

## 📈 Model Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of approximately **78%**, indicating a reliable performance in predicting diabetes cases.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nawedul07/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction

Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.
